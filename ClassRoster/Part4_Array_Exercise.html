    <h1>Welcome! Please answer the following prompts to create a class roster:</h1>
    <p>
      This is a very simple web app that contains an array of student names in a .js file.
      The website will prompt you for four possible commands to alter your student roster:
      <b>add</b>,<b>remove</b>,<b>display</b>, and <b>quit</b>.

      This web page will prompt you for one of the commands. Here is what
      each command should do:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>add</b>: will prompt you for a student name.
        The name will then be added to the student to the array of student names in the .js file</li>
        <li><b>remove</b>: will cprompt you for the student name you wish to remove, then remove this name from the roster array</li>
        <li><b>display</b>: will print out the roster</li>
        <li><b>quit:</b>will end the editing period for your class roster.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is a simple app where the names will appear in the console (to view simply right click, click 'inspect' in the drop down, and click the tab for 'Console')
      and will not be readily accessible elsewhere.
    </p>

    <h4><span style='color:red'> It is important to note if you are reviewing these instructions above as you can <b>NOT</b> see the displayed
      class roster in your console (please see above for instructions on how to open the console), refresh the page with the Developer Tools Console
      (as described above) already open rather than opening the console once the app is already running.</span></h4>
